noncategorized projects done to serve my needs

Currently working on: 
    1. A simple display of Bainbridge Island traffic cams and Seattle ferry data making a trip to Seattle from the island more informed. It will be able to tell me how many spots are left on the to-be-transitting ferry and trips scheduled currently. As well as images updated every 2 minutes of current traffic on the island towards the ferry. I may also add a traffic dispaly from either google maps api or waze or etc.
    2. I have been making several 3d prints for various projects and hacks. Most recently I have completed an enclosure rougly sized for my Nixie Clock. Another print is a part used for making an iPhone 3gs take on the function of being a camera for a 3d printer so to be able to monitor its progress and errors.
